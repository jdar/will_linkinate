== DESCRIPTION:

Scaffolding for Associations with Smart & Flexible syntax options and delimiters.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* it's not perfect. (that's for sure)
* the scaffolding isn't actually done, for one thing.

== SYNOPSIS:

 @seller.products.linkinate :path_to_more => seller_products_path(@seller), 
                           :limit=>3

  #=> Apples, Oranges, Bananas, and 18 more fruits. 
 ... where each fruit name links to that fruit, and "18 more fruits" links to sellers_products_path(@seller)

 see more * http://dariusroberts.com/posts/will_linkinate-gem-published
 ... or look at the source code in init.rb. It's pretty easy to read. Just a bunch of config checks.

== REQUIREMENTS:

Rails

== INSTALL:

gem.config "will_linkinate", :lib=>'will_linkinate', :source=>'http://gems.github.com' in environment.rb
then
rake gems:install (eventually. Not yet.)

... and if you want to use the HAML-based generators, you will eventually be able to /generate linkinate_scaffold post comment:references   ... but I think you'll have to declare your models first ... the scaffold will use your has_many declarations.
